        "Hi, I'm Mapule Mbuzwana, an experienced Full Stack Developer passionate about turning ideas into digital solutions. I have a strong background in both building the parts of websites you see (front-end) and making sure everything works behind the scenes (back-end).",
        "I specialize in creating easy-to-use designs for websites and setting up systems that handle lots of users without slowing down. Beyond coding, I love designing unique website templates that are both stylish and practical, aiming to make online experiences better for everyone. When I'm not coding, I enjoy relaxing with my favorite TV shows for inspiration. I also find joy in spending time outdoors, taking photos of beautiful scenery and going on refreshing hikes."
